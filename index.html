      <h2>About Us</h2>
      <p>
        We are a student-led initiative dedicated to spreading kindness and supporting underprivileged communities through meaningful action. Our project organizes a donation drive that collects gently used clothes from students, repairs them if needed, and distributes them to those in need before the winter season.
      <p>
        In addition to clothing, we raise cash donations to purchase essential items for a local orphanage—ensuring broader impact and care.
      </p>
        <p>
        To make giving easier and more accessible, we’ve integrated Artificial Intelligence into our mission. Our website and chatbot help spread awareness, share important information, and guide donors through a simple, seamless donation process.
          </p>
        Together, we’re using compassion and technology to make a real difference.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our core belief is that small, well-focused interventions — when executed with local collaboration — create lasting change. We aim to build bridges (Setu) for hope (Asha) across communities.
