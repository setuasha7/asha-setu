      <h2>Get To Know Us</h2>
      <p>
        We are a student-led initiative dedicated to spreading kindness and supporting underprivileged communities through meaningful action. 
        Our project organizes a donation drive that collects gently used clothes from students, repairs them if needed, and distributes them to those 
        in need before the winter season.
        In addition to clothing, we raise cash donations to purchase essential items for a local orphanage—ensuring broader impact and care.
        To make giving easier and more accessible, we’ve integrated Artificial Intelligence into our mission. Our website and chatbot help spread awareness, share important information, and guide do[...]
        Together, we’re using compassion and technology to make a real difference.
        Our core belief is that small, well-focused interventions — when executed with local collaboration — create lasting change. We aim to build bridges (Setu) 
        for hope (Asha) across communities

      <h2>Our Objectives</h2>
      <p>This initiative aims to Promote Social Responsibility by encouraging students and the wider community to participate in meaningful acts of kindness, 
        such as donation drives. A core goal is to Collect Clothing specifically, gently used items in good condition to distribute to the underprivileged before 
        winter. We will also Support Orphanages with Essentials by raising cash donations to purchase critical supplies and daily necessities. To Leverage 
        Technology for Impact, we are utilizing a website and an AI-powered chatbot to boost awareness, simplify the donation process, and enhance donor 
        engagement. Ultimately, we seek to Build a Sustainable Model that can be replicated annually, ensuring long-term community support and continuous student 
        involvement, while also working to Bridge Gaps Between Donors and Recipients by creating a transparent, efficient, and empathetic channel for connection.</p>
